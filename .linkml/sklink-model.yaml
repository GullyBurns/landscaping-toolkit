# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of the Biolink Model specification
# are resolved using a specific precedence order, for use in the generation of the Biolink Model context.jsonld
# mappings to namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Biolink Model but not resolved by the following
# precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's
# which should ideally be repaired in one of the precedence lists.

   ## QUALIFIERS
   ## -------------------

  form or variant qualifier:
    is_a: qualifier
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object concept to define a specific type, variant,
      alternative version of this concept. The composed concept remains a subtype or instance of the core concept.
      For example, the qualifier ‘mutation’ combines with the core concept ‘Gene X’ to express the compose concept
      ‘a mutation of Gene X’.
    examples:
      - value: mutation
      - value: late stage
      - value: severe
      - value: transplant
      - value: chemical analog
    notes: >-
      please see the ChemicalOrGeneOrGeneProductFormOrVariantEnum (below) for examples of 'form or variant qualifier'
      terms in the gene->chemical association space. 
      the qualifier ‘mutation’ combines with the core concept ‘Gene X’ to express the compose concept ‘Mutated forms of Gene X’.
      the qualifier ‘late stage’ combines with a core concept of ‘Disease X’ to express the  more specific concept ‘Late Stage forms of Disease X’
      the qualifier ‘recombinant’ combines with a core concept of ‘FLT1 Gene’ to express the composed concept ‘Recombinant forms of the FLT1 gene’
      the qualifier ‘chemical analog’ combines with a core concept of ‘Ditiocarb’ to express the composed concept ‘analog forms of Ditiocarb’
    in_subset:

  aspect qualifier:
    is_a: qualifier
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which
      the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that
      inheres in the core concept.  The purpose of the aspect slot is to indicate what aspect is being affected in an 
      'affects' association.
    examples:
      - value: stability
      - value: abundance
      - value: expression
      - value: exposure
    notes: >-
      for good examples of aspects in the gene-> chemical space, please see the 
      GeneOrGeneProductOrChemicalEntityAspectEnum (below) which lists many aspects that can be used to qualify 
      the gene making the full subject a different ontological type.  
      the qualifier ‘expression’ combines with a core concept of ‘Gene X’ to express the composed concept ‘expression of Gene X’ (Gene → Biological Process)
      the qualifier ‘exposure’ combines with a core concept of ‘Chemical X’ to express the composed concept ‘exposure to Chemical X’ (Chemical → Exposure Process)
      the qualifier ‘activity’ combines with a core concept of ‘PPARG’ to express the concept ‘activity of PPARG’ (Gene → function/activity)
      the qualifier ‘emergency Department Visit’ combines with a core concept of ‘Disease X’ to express the concept ‘Emergency Department visits for Disease X’ (Disease → Clinical Event)
      the qualifier ‘infection’ combines with a core concept of ‘Giardia’ to express the concept ‘Infection with Giardia’ (Taxon → Biological / Pathological Process)
      the qualifier ‘severity’ combines with a core concept of ‘DILI’ to express the concept ‘the severity level of DILI’ (Disease → (intrinsic) Characteristic/Quality)
      the qualifier ‘abundance’ combines with a core concept of ‘BRCA2’ to express the concept ‘abundance of BRCA2’ (Gene → (extrinsic) characteristic/quality)
    in_subset:
      - translator_minimal

  derivative qualifier:
    is_a: qualifier
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object  concept to describe something that is derived from the
      core concept.  For example, the qualifier ‘metabolite’ combines with a ‘Chemical X’ core concept to express
      the composed concept ‘a metabolite of Chemical X’.
    examples:
      - value: metabolite
    in_subset:
      - translator_minimal

  part qualifier:
    is_a: qualifier
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can
      use to directly represent it, e.g. 'ESR1 transcript' q: polyA tail).
    examples:
      - value: polyA tail
      - value: upstream control region
    in_subset:
      - translator_minimal

  context qualifier:
    is_a: qualifier
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Restricts the setting/context/location where the core concept (or qualified core concept) resides or occurs.
    examples:
      - value: cohort x (e.g. a specific population, referenced by an identifier)
      - value: gut microbiome  # OHMI:0000020
    in_subset:
      - translator_minimal

  direction qualifier:
    is_a: qualifier
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept (+ aspect if provided) to describe a change in its direction or degree.
    notes: >-
      the qualifier ‘increased’ combines with a core concept of ‘Gene X’ and an aspect of ‘expression’ to express the composed concept ‘increased expression of Gene X’   
      the qualifier ‘decreased’ combines with a core concept of ‘Protein X’ and an aspect of ‘abundance’ to express the composed concept ‘decreased abundance of Protein X’

  qualified predicate:
    is_a: qualifier
    description: >-
      Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full
      reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or 
      increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that 
      expressed by the primary predicate, in a ‘full statement’ reading of the association, where qualifier-based 
      semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a 
      full statement reading.
    notes: >-
      to express the statement that “Chemical X causes increased expression of Gene Y”, the core triple is read 
      using the fields subject:ChemX, predicate:affects, object:GeneY . . . and the full statement is read using 
      the fields subject:ChemX, qualified_predicate:causes, object:GeneY, object_aspect: expression, 
      object_direction:increased. The predicate ‘affects’ is needed for the core triple reading, but does not make 
      sense in the full statement reading  (because “Chemical X affects increased expression of Gene Y'' is not 
      what we mean to say here: it causes increased expression of Gene Y)

      Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically

      'related to'. This relationship holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical 
      dependence is demonstrated.  E.g. the statement “Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) is associated with Myocardial 
      Infraction (MI)” asserts that having Afib is not statistically independent from whether a patient 
      will also have MI. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to 
      the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an 
      Association (e.g. diseases, chemical entities or processes).

  ontology class:

    slots:
      - id
    description: >-
      a concept or class in an ontology, vocabulary or thesaurus. Note that nodes in
      a biolink compatible KG can be considered both instances of biolink classes, and
      OWL classes in their own right. In general you should not need to use this class directly.
      Instead, use the appropriate biolink class. For example, for the GO concept of endocytosis (GO:0006897),
      use bl:BiologicalProcess as the type.
    exact_mappings:
      - owl:Class
      - schema:Class
    comments:
      - >-
        This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a
        node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative bioloink category, such as AnatomicalEntity
        (for Uberon classes), ChemicalSubstance (for CHEBI or CHEMBL), etc
      - >-
        Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
        but can be the object of 'type' edges. For example, if we had a node in the graph representing
        a specific brain of a specific patient (e.g brain001), this could have a category of bl:Sample,
        and by typed more specifically with an ontology class UBERON:nnn, which has as category bl:AnatomicalEntity

      that are selected by a curator because they may be useful as evidence for deriving knowledge about a specific 
      focus of the study. The notion of a 'study' here is defined broadly to include any research activity at any 
      scale that is aimed at generating knowledge or hypotheses. This may include a single assay or computational
