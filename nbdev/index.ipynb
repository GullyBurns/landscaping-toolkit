This is a library of components designed to support and facilitate 'scientific knowledge landscaping' within the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Science Program. It consists of several utility libraries to help build and analyze corpora of scientific knowledge expressed both as natural language and structured data. This system is built on the excellent [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) package that uses notebooks as a vehicle for development."

When you push this repository to Github from Databricks, Jupyter notebooks will be built, added to the repo and then processed by nbdev to generate modules and documentation (refer to https://nbdev.fast.ai/ for full documentation on how to do this).
