This is a library of components designed to support and facilitate 'scientific knowledge landscaping' within the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Science Program. It consists of several utility libraries to help build and analyze corpora of scientific knowledge expressed both as natural language and structured data. This system is built on the excellent [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) package that uses notebooks as a vehicle for development. "

    "2. Place your scripts and utility notebooks in subdirectories of the `databricks` folder in the file hierarchy.\n",

When you push this repository to Github from Databricks, Jupyter notebooks will be built, added to the repo and then processed by nbdev to generate modules and documentation (refer to https://nbdev.fast.ai/ for full documentation on how to do this). Note that pushing code to Github will add and commit *more* code to github, requiring you to perform another `git pull` to load and refer to the latest changes in your code. "
